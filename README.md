# ipgp

Use the [PGP word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGP_word_list) list to represent IPv4 addresses

Do your eyes glaze over when quickly trying to compare addresses like `56.39.187.101` and `58.89.137.107`?

Would it be easier if they were `classic celebrate shamrock glossary` and `cleanup examine nightbird Hamilton`?
